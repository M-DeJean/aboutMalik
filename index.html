              <h2 class="headingTitle"> About Malik </h2>
              <p>From a young age, I was always interested in building things. From Lego cities, to     Hot  Wheels racetracks, the process of creating something has always fascinated me.   It   was only a   matter of time before I had my own PC and fell in love with the   endless   creative   possibilities that came with it. After graduating high school, I   was fortunate   enough to   participate in a Hackathon with Live Nation's tech department in Hollywood. This   was my introduction to software engineering   and I've dreamt of having   a career as a developer ever since.</p>
